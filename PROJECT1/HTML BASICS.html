    <p><h2>HTML Basic Examples</h2>
        In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.<br>
        Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.<br>
        HTML Documents
        All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: DOCTYPE html.<br>
        The HTML document itself begins with html and ends with html<br>
        The visible part of the HTML document is between body and body.</p>

        <P>The !DOCTYPE Declaration<BR>
            <img src="DOCTYPE EXAMPLSE.png" alt="DOCTYPE"><br>
        The !DOCTYPE declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    The !DOCTYPE declaration is not case sensitive.
    The !DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is:<BR>
    DOCTYPE html<BR>
    HTML Headings<BR>
    HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags.<br>
    h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading:<br>

    <h2>HTML Paragraphs</h2>
       <P>HTML paragraphs are defined with the p tag:</P>
        <img src="PRAGRAPH EXAMPLE.png" alt="HTML PARAGRAPHS">
        <h2>HTML LINKS</h2>
        <p>Html links are defined by the tag a href:
            The link's destination is specified in the href attribute.<br>
            Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.<br>
            You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter </p><br>
        <img src="LINKS EXAMPLE.png" alt="HTML LINK">
        <h2>HTML IMAGES </h2>
        <p> HTML images are defined with the <br> img tag.
            The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
        <img src="IMG EXAMPLES.png" alt="HTML IMAGES">

    <h1>How to View HTML Source</h1>
Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered "Hey! How did they do that?"
<h1>View HTML Source Code:</h1>
Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.
<h1>Inspect an HTML Element:</h1>
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.
