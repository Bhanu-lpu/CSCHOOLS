    <p><h1>Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit</h1>
        Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.,<br>
        
        However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).<br>
        
        We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.<br>
        
        Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.
        
        <h2>Step 1:</h2> Open Notepad (PC)
        Windows 8 or later:<br>
        
        Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.
        
        Windows 7 or earlier:
        
        Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad
        <h2>Step 1:</h2> Open TextEdit (Mac)
        Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit<br>
        Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly.<br> In Preferences > Format>choose "Plain Text"
        Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".
        Then open a new document to place the code.
        <h2>Step 2:</h2> Write Some HTML
        Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:<BR>
        <img src="HTML NOTEPAD EXAMPLE.png">
        <H2>Step 3:</H2><BR> Save the HTML Page
        Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.
        Name the file "index.html" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).
        <H2>Step 4:</H2> View the HTML Page in Your Browser
        Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").
        The result will look much like this:<br>
